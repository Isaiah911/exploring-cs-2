   	<p>These readings brought to light how big of a tragedy the failure of Reconstruction truly was. Had Reconstruction gone accordingly, the integration of black people as equals in American society would have happened far quicker and more efficiently. Significant steps were made during reconstruction such as, the representation of African Americans in government, civil rights legislation, African Americans earning the right to vote and new educational systems that allowed anyone to attend, ect. Had Reconstruction not been fought back against so harshly and abandoned by so many Republicans, much of the progress made would lead to long-lasting equality for black people, thus creating a more forward thinking America.
